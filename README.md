- Enterprise Network Lab Setup
This lab simulates a corporate IT infrastructure with Active Directory (AD), Domain Name System (DNS), and Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) in a virtualized environment.

Lab Requirements:
Virtualization Software: VMware Workstation, VirtualBox, or Hyper-V
Operating System: Windows Server (2016, 2019, or 2022)
Client OS: Windows 10/11 for testing
Network: Internal or Host-Only network
Step 1: Set Up a Windows Server VM
Install Windows Server on a virtual machine.
Assign a static IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.10).
Rename the server (e.g., DC01).
Step 2: Configure Active Directory (AD DS)
Open Server Manager â†’ Add Roles and Features.
Install Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS).
Promote the server to a Domain Controller (DC).
Create a domain (e.g., corp.local).
Reboot and verify domain setup.
Step 3: Set Up DNS
In Server Manager, go to DNS Manager.
Configure Forward Lookup Zones for the domain (corp.local).
Verify DNS resolution using nslookup.
Step 4: Configure DHCP
Install the DHCP Server role via Server Manager.
Configure a DHCP scope:
Scope Name: Corporate LAN
IP Range: 192.168.1.100 - 192.168.1.200
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
Gateway: 192.168.1.1
DNS: 192.168.1.10 (AD DS Server)
Authorize and activate the DHCP scope.
Step 5: Join a Client Machine to the Domain
Set up a Windows 10/11 VM.
Assign an IP via DHCP.
Join the domain (corp.local).
Verify domain login using Active Directory users.
Community Tech Support Initiative Setup
This project involves repairing PCs/printers and training users on security best practices.

Step 1: Hardware & Software Repair
PC Repair Tasks:

Run hardware diagnostics.
Check disk health (chkdsk /f).
Optimize performance by clearing temporary files (cleanmgr).
Printer Repair Tasks:

Update printer drivers.
Clear print spooler (net stop spooler & net start spooler).
Step 2: Security Training Topics
Strong Passwords: Enforce password complexity.
Phishing Awareness: Identify suspicious emails.
System Updates: Enable auto-updates for OS and antivirus.
Data Backup: Use OneDrive or external drives for backups.
